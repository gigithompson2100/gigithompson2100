  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a dedicated educator passionate about student-centered, real-world learning.
    My teaching focuses on project-based, interdisciplinary instruction that allows
    students to apply their learning across multiple areas of their lives.
  </p>

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    My teaching philosophy is grounded in student-centered learning that emphasizes
    real-world, project-based experiences. I believe students learn best when they
    understand the “why” behind their learning and are given choice in how they engage
    with content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through systems-based learning, students develop intrinsic motivation, independence,
    and the skills needed to become lifelong learners.
